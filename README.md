# Ultrasonic Pi Piano with Gesture Control

As featured on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/22/ultrasonic-raspberry-pi-piano/)! This project for the Raspberry Pi uses cheap HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors as inputs and turns them into keys on a MIDI keyboard. There's something pretty neat about using sound to make sound. It's like fighting fire with fire, but much safer.

There is a detailed [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Ultrasonic-Pi-Piano-With-Gesture-Controls/) with full information on how to make this project.
